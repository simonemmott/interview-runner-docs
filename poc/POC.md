# Interview Runner Proof Of Concept

The `Interview Runner` proof of concept needs to demonstrate that it is possible to
propose questions in an interview which are relevant to the candidates reported experience
and the job specification in question.

The following are **NOT REQUIRED** for the proof of concept:
* Security and user roles
* Maintenance of competency areas (beyond creating them)
* Maintenance of job specifications (beyond creating them)
* Maintenance of Candidates (beyond creating them)
* Maintenance of Interviews (beyond creating and running them)
* Comparing Multiple Candidates to a given specification

For the proof of concept it must be possible to define:
* Competency Areas
* Job Specifications
* Candidates
* Interview Questions
* Interviews

It must be possible to `run` an interview, and show that:
* A candidate claiming experience in the sub competencies of the specification proposes suitable questions to ask the candidate about their experience.
* Record the candidates response in real time during the interview
* Ask several questions about one competency in the specification.
* Ask questions about several/all the competencies in the specification.
* Record metadata about the questions in real time during the interview.

It must be possible to report on a candidates fit for the role being interviewed.

The functionality required by this proof of concept is detailed in the following use cases.
